            <b>DELETE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA</b>
            <br />
            I won't bother rehashing any of the million reasons to delete your
            social media apps.
            <br />
            You know most of them already anyway!
            <br />
            I'm just bugging you about it; if you were looking for a sign to
            finally just delete tiktok, instagram, facebook, vk, twitter, etc., this is it.

            Have you tried to access this site but found that it was down? Pity!
            Unfortunately I turn my server on and off at will, including
            when I go to sleep.
            <br />
            My tinnitus isn't bad enough yet that I'd rather have the constant fan
            buzzing through the night.
            <br />

            Anyway that's about it, move along, this URL is busy doing the 99%
            of its networking which ISN'T serving a little static HTML.
